Disturbance Input Decoupling (DID) used to solve the vibration issue of a dangerous liguid with unknown property.   
Disturbance input decoupling is a cancellation technique where the disturbance is fed to the controller output in opposition to the effect of the disturbance.  

# Problem Formulation
• The train is transferring a dangerous liquid (ex: Nitroglycerin)  
• The liquid cannot resist severe wobble and should not spill over  
• The train start driving in a constant acceleration of 9.81 𝑚/𝑠! and maintain at the velocity 41.667 𝑚/𝑠 (150 𝑘𝑚/h𝑟)  
• The mechanical property of the liquid is unknown  
• Assume the road is flat
